## Create a Github repo	

Create a Github repo with the name of your project. Clone it to your machine. Open a text editor inside of it.

## Django Project Creation

Make sure Python is installed globally on your system. You can do this by writing `python3 --version`. 
Then install django globally on your machine by running this command in your terminal - `pip install django`. To check if django has successfully isntalled, do `pip list` command and see if django package is there. Okay, now you have python and django installed.

Time to create a django project. Run the following command - `django-admin startproject project`. Now you should see a folder called "project" in your current directory. Inside of that folder there is another folder called "project". Delete one "project" folder, make sure only one "project" folder, manage.py and README.md remains.

Push to github.
